Mastermind challenge from Hopson Discord server.

Accepts these optional paramaters:

`-easy` - Easy mode, displays the positions of the characters you have guessed correctly.

`-self` - The program will solve the word itself 

`-lives <amount>` - Set the amount of lives you want you/the computer to have (7 by default).

`-length <amount>` - Set the length of the word (random by default).

`-file <local_file_name>` - Set the word list the program uses to the given local file (local wordslist.txt by default.)

e.g, `ruby index.rb -self -file otherlist.txt -lives 10 -length 5`



Compact: 

accepts no optional paramters, made to be as small as I could make it with it still being playable.
